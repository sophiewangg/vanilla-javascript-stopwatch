# vanilla-javascript-timer
My first javascript project! 

###Description: 
This project is a timer made using Javascript, HTML and CSS. The timer includes a reset button, and a start button that changes to a stop button (and back) when 
clicked. The CSS style sheet brings a minimalistic yet cute look to the webpage. This project was a fun way for me to apply my knowledge, but also learn more about 
Javascript and web development. Many of the functions used in the project were new to me, and thus required some extra attention. In the future, I would like to 
upgrade this project into a pomodoro timer, hopefully helping myself and others stay focused and motivated during school and beyond.
